# rustandr

<!-- badges: start -->
<!-- badges: end -->

The goal of `rustandr` is to provide a template to run Rust code through and R package.
It's practice and note keeping for myself.

## Installation

You can install development version from [GitHub](https://github.com/jmbarbone/rustandr) with:

``` r
# install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("jmbarbone/rustandr")
```
## Example

This is a basic example which shows you how to solve a common problem:

```{r example}
library(rustandr)
## basic example code
foo_hello()
foo_int()
foo_intn(1:100)
foo_intn(seq(-12L, 1L, 17L))

# multiplies x by y
foo_intxy(3L, 8L)

# divides x by y
foo_dblxy(61, 7)
```
